# RoseDaggerKiLibs

RoseDaggerKiLibs is a collection of KiCad libraries I maintain for use in my hardware projects.  
It contains symbols, footprints, and 3D models that support my other repos.  
Placing this project in the same root folder as my other projects ensures that 3D models load correctly in KiCadâ€™s viewer.
